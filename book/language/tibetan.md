# Tibetan Words

Tibetan words are composed out of a finite set of syllables. We then
have a set of words composed out of these syllables, and these go into
the dictionary trie. We can possible create a second trie, the
theoretical trie, which is really a directed graph, connecting all
syllables to each other. Then we can say this might be a word, but it
has no definition, at least.
